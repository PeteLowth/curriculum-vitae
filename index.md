## Experience

### Munich Re
`2019-07 - now`
__Data and Analytics Lead, Digital Partners__
- Responsibility for the platform used for analytics and data ingestion for all data received from our European InsurTech partners
- Led a large transformation of our data platform, including the selection, design and implementation of a number of modern data tools:
  - Looker: Business Intelligence platform enabling widespread self-serve analytics and real-time reporting via a curated data model
  - Snowflake: Cloud Data Warehouse which has yielded material analytics performance improvements and increased flexibility and scalability in defining and delivering on our data strategy
  - Airflow: automation and monitoring of previously ad-hoc and manual ETL workflows
  - The platform is built and maintained in agile teams following robust engineering practices, including CI/CD pipelines in GitLab and role-based access controls. This was critical to passing a recent internal data warehouse audit. 
- Work closely with InsurTech partners and internal stakeholders to define, implement, test and monitor data integrations
- Support internal pricing, product, claims and finance teams with their data and analytics, including: 
  - Automation of reserving and forecasting pipelines with ETLs and machine learning
  - Real-time claims alerts and sales monitoring integrated with our main communication tool (Slack)
  - Advanced risk and behavioural modelling pipelines using xgboost and tensorflow (proof of concept)
- Manage a team of two data analysts
